Personal Webpage

Some findings on what the template is doing:
-for margins: use css!
-#main > section.two { 
background-color: #1b7171;
changes the background color and somehow is still white
-I'm already sick of the brown background, without even actually using it. switch back to shades of grey
-find a way to let sidebar side in from left when starting side
-find way to let titlepage fit display-resolution (ie looks sht on 16:10)
